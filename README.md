Title: Network File Fetcher - Python Project

Description:
I am excited to share my latest Python project, "Network File Fetcher," which I developed to facilitate seamless data access and sharing between server and client networks. This innovative project leverages socket programming to establish a robust LAN connection, making it efficient and secure for data transmission.

Key Features:
🔗 Direct Connection: Network File Fetcher enables a direct connection between server and client networks, granting access to data with the appropriate permissions.

📂 File Details Access: The project can access file details in the present working directory (PWD) and generate compressed tar.gz files, ready to be stored on the client's computer.

🔐 Secure Server Binding: By implementing server binding, Network File Fetcher enhances data security, ensuring that files are shared only with authorized users.

📡 Fast Connection: Thanks to optimized networking, the project establishes connections in just 0.6 seconds, making the process swift and efficient.

🔑 Root Access: Root access is required to initiate the process, ensuring that the data transmission remains secure and controlled.

🌐 Pipeline Feature: To enhance connection security, Network File Fetcher utilizes the pipeline feature to access the operating system's networking capabilities.

This project represents the convergence of networking and programming skills, providing a valuable solution for efficient data sharing between server and client networks. If you're interested in learning more or exploring collaboration opportunities, please feel free to connect with me.
